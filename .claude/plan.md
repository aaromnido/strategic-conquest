- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

### Version Control
- Commit after each completed task
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create branches for major features (optional)

### Testing Strategy

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI too complex/time-consuming | Start with simple rule-based AI, iterate later |
| Hexagonal rendering difficult | Use existing libraries or tutorials as reference |
| Performance issues | Optimize rendering, limit map size |
| Scope creep | Stick to MVP, defer nice-to-haves |
| Browser compatibility | Test early and often on multiple browsers |

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 0:** Set up development environment
2. Create folder structure
3. Initialize Flask app
4. Create basic HTML/CSS skeleton
5. Verify server runs and canvas displays
