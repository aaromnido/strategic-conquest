2. Write unit tests
3. Implement API endpoint
4. Build frontend UI
5. Test integration
6. Commit changes

### Code Quality
- Use type hints in Python
- Write docstrings for functions
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

### Version Control
- Commit after each completed task
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create branches for major features (optional)

### Testing Strategy
- Test each feature as it's built
- Play the game frequently during development
- Get feedback from others (if possible)

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI too complex/time-consuming | Start with simple rule-based AI, iterate later |
| Hexagonal rendering difficult | Use existing libraries or tutorials as reference |
| Performance issues | Optimize rendering, limit map size |
| Scope creep | Stick to MVP, defer nice-to-haves |
| Browser compatibility | Test early and often on multiple browsers |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 0:** Set up development environment
2. Create folder structure
3. Initialize Flask app
4. Create basic HTML/CSS skeleton
5. Verify server runs and canvas displays

**First Commit:** "Initial project setup with Flask and basic frontend structure"
